* What is this?

sf2xrni is a Renoise tool for creating XRNI (instrument) files from a
SoundFont sf2 file.

* Usage

	$ (mono) sf2xrni(.exe) sf2-files

	For mono, you'll need the latest build from trunk (I made a fix
	which is only in trunk so far).

	A directory is created to contain a set of XRNI files.

* Conversion Basics

	A soundfont file contains more than one Presets.
	A Preset is mapped to an XRN Instrument.
	A SF2 Preset contains more than one Instruments.
	An Instrument contains more than one Zones, and each Zone contains
	a SampleHeader, which is a set of information to retrieve raw sample.

* Dependencies

sf2xrni uses a couple of libraries:

- NRenoiseTools, to write XRNI files.
  http://www.codeplex.com/nrenoisetools
- NAudio, which contains SoundFont2 file format support.
  http://naudio.codeplex.com/
- ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib. It is just NRenoiseTools dependency

The prebuilt assemblies are in the repo.
